\block{Abstract}
{
Recent interest in the dynamics of stratified turbulence has led to the
development of new models for quantifying vertical transport of momentum and
buoyancy (Chini {\em et al} 2022, Shah {\em et al} 2024). These models are still
incomplete as they do not yet include all of the relevant dynamics often present
in real physical settings such as rotation and magnetic fields. Here we expand
on prior work by adding rotation. We conduct 3D direct numerical simulations of
rotating, stochastically forced, strongly stratified turbulence ($Fr \ll  1$), and vary the Rossby number. We find that rotation gradually suppresses small-scale 3D motions and therefore inhibits vertical transport as Ro decreases towards Fr. The effect is particularly pronounced within the cores of emergent cyclonic vortices. For sufficiently strong rotation, vertical motions are entirely suppressed.

    Nonrotating stratified turbulence is characterized by strongly
    anisotropic pancake structures within the flow.

    Rotation promotes barotropic structures which are invariant along the axis
    of rotation.
